Changes:
 - Added patch notes
 - Changed channel linking to show channel "mention"
 - Added better logging

Upcoming Features
 - Work on phase 1 of the challenge has begun but will definitely take time since I'm in this alone.
 - For this phase, I will announce when it begins via a patch note and give a starting hint.
 I will not do this for future parts, as I want to keep things a surprise, but generally things will follow a theme.
 I'm thinking of also including a hint for the next "phase" after completion of one, since I don't want people to be super confused.
